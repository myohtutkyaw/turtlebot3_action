# üê¢ TurtleBot3 Action Project
ROS2-based project implementing action servers and clients to control TurtleBot3 simulation tasks such as rotation, square path, and circle movement.

---

##  Objective
To develop a modular action-based control system for TurtleBot3 using **ROS2**.  
This project demonstrates understanding of **action servers, clients, and service-based communication** in autonomous robot control.

---

##  Features
- Absolute and accumulated rotation using custom `Rotate.action`
- Square path navigation using service clients and servers
- Continuous circular motion publisher
- Odom logging and motion tracking
- Designed for simulation in Gazebo or RViz2
